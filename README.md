In this project, I have developed a python program that uses the fama and french 3 factor model to analyze stocks and generate alpha. The program uses data from the Yahoo! Finance API to retrieve stock data and calculate the necessary metrics for the fama and french model.

To use the program, users will need to input the ticker of the stock they want to analyze, as well as the start and end dates for the analysis. The program will then retrieve the necessary data and run the analysis, outputting the results in a user-friendly format.

In addition to the main program, I have also included a sample dataset and instructions on how to use the program in the docs directory.

I hope that this project will be useful for others who are interested in using the fama and french 3 factor model for stock analysis. Any feedback or suggestions for improvements are welcome.
